A genetic algorithm that teaches virtual bots to navigate through a maze 🗺️. Built with **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, and designed to run directly in the browser.  

🌱 **The goal**: evolve generations of bots to find the optimal path from start to finish while avoiding walls.  

Soon on GitHub Pages!!!<!-- 👉 [**Try it live on GitHub Pages**](https://<SEU_USUARIO>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>)   -->

## 🛠️ Features

- 🧬 Evolutionary algorithm (crossover + mutation)
- 🕹️ Interactive maze creation
- 📈 Shows generation-by-generation progress
- ⚡ Runs entirely in-browser, no installation required



## 📦 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PTurquetti/MazeSolver_GeneticAlgorithm.git
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Build your maze, set start and end points, and run the algorithm!

Soon available on GitHub Pages 😃



## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack

- Vanilla **JavaScript (ES6 modules)**
- **HTML5** & **CSS3**
- GitHub Pages for hosting



## 🧠 How it works

Each bot is represented as a binary sequence of movements. Over generations, they:
- **Mutate** to explore new paths
- **Crossover** to combine successful strategies
- **Evolve** to reach the goal
